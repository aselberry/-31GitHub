So basically in Jav access modifiers are the ones that determine whether the variables/instant variables are 
**`private`** or **`public`**. When instant variable of the parent class set to private, it cannot be accessed 
or modified by the child class. To enable this option for the child is to use **`protected`** access modifier keyword. 

So, when do we use **`final` f**or method in parent class? When we want to ensure that any child of this class cannot 
modify the result or return value of this method. According to the CodeAcademy, it allows to avoid some bags that might
happen when in some child we want to change something. There is no specific order of writing final keyword to the method.
But it is recommended to wrote **`public final`** instead of `**final public**`.
