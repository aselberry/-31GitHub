What does Docker Container mean?

Docker Container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of
software that includes everything needed to run an application: 
code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. 

Container images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker Containers -
images become containers when they run on Docker Engine. Available for both Linux
and Windows-based applications, containerized software will always run the same,
regardless of the infrastructure. Containers isolate software from 
its environment and ensure that it works unifornly despite differences
for instance between development and staging. 

Comparing Containers and Virtual Machines: 
Containers and virtual machines have simlar resource isolation and allocation
benefits, but function differently because containers virtualize the operating system
instead of hardware. Containers are more portable and efficient. 

Containers are an abstraction at the app layer that packages code and 
dependencies together. Multiple containers can run on the same machine and
share the OS kernel with other containers, each running as isolated
processes in user space. Containers take upless space than VMs, can handle
more applications and require fewer VMs and Operating Systems. 

Virtual machines (VMs) are an abstraction of physical hardware turning one server into 
many servers. The hypervisor allows multiple VMs to run on a single machine. Each VM 
includes a full copy of an operating system, the application, necessary binaries and 
libraries â€“ taking up tens of GBs. VMs can also be slow to boot.
