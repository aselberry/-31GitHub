So, to use stack in Java you need to declare Stack as a  variable.  It is very similar to the ArrayList declaration. You also need to import Stack library with the help of `import java.util.Stack` 

import java.util.Stack;

class HelloWorld {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Stack<String> learn = new Stack<String>();
String[] learning = {"apple", "cherry", "speech", "Student"};
for(String str : learning){
learn.push(str);
}

    System.out.println(learn.pop());
    System.out.println(learn.pop());
    System.out.println(learn.pop());
    System.out.println(learn.pop());
}

}

OUTPUT: 

Student
speech
cherry
apple
